The CometVisu is a visualisation but building automation applications like
smart homes.

It only requires a web browser to display it and a web server as well as a 
backend it can communicate with. The web server can be quite small (routers
should already have enough power) as it is only serving static content. For 
extended features it should support PHP, but that is optional and not required.

There are currently two different backends widely used: 
1) einbread-cgi / eibwrite-cgi are directly communicating with the eibd / knxd
   to have direct access to the KNX bus.
2) OpenHAB can also be used as a backend.

As extended functionality the diagram plugin can be used. This will require 
a rrdtool installation with the added "fetchj" feature.

Please always also refer the online documentation at 

     http://www.cometvisu.org/

as it will contain the latest information.

To discuss with the developers you can use the mailing list that is
provided at the SourceForge project page or use the KNX User Forum
at http://knx-user-forum.de/forum/supportforen/cometvisu/ (spoken languages are
German and English)

*** Notes on the KNX-backend ***
The KNX-backend uses
/usr/lib/cgi-bin/l : a dummy-login
/usr/lib/cgi-bin/r : a symlink to /usr/bin/eibread-cgi
/usr/lib/cgi-bin/w : a symlink to /usr/bin/eibwrite-cgi
eibread/write-cgi are part of a modified eibd-clients package here:

(source: bcusdk)

*** Important note on diagram-backend ***
It uses a modified version of rrdtool, adding a "fetchj" option.
